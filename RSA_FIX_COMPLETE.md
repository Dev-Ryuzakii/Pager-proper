## üîí RSA Decryption Fix - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

### Problem Identified
The RSA decryption was failing with "Incorrect decryption" error because there was a **key mismatch** between:
- The public key stored on the server for user `tougen`  
- The actual public key corresponding to `tougen`'s private key file

### Root Cause
When users generate new RSA key pairs, the client updates the private key file locally but the server wasn't always getting the updated public key. This created a mismatch where:
1. Sender encrypts messages using the OLD public key from server
2. Receiver tries to decrypt with NEW private key 
3. Decryption fails because keys don't match

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Server-Side Public Key Sync During Login
**File:** `server_integrated.py`
- Modified login handler to accept and update `public_key` field during login
- Server now syncs public keys automatically when clients login
- Added logging for key updates

#### 2. Key Resync Tool
**File:** `resync_keys.py`
- Created tool to detect and fix key mismatches
- Compares server public keys with actual private key files
- Automatically updates server storage with correct public keys

#### 3. RSA Debug Test
**File:** `test_rsa_debug.py` 
- Tests RSA encryption/decryption for all users
- Verifies key matching between server storage and private keys
- Provides detailed diagnostics for key issues

### Test Results ‚úÖ
```
üîç Testing kami:
‚úÖ Keys match! RSA round-trip successful!

üîç Testing tougen:  
‚úÖ Keys match! RSA round-trip successful!
```

### How to Test the Fix

1. **Server is Running** (port 5050):
   ```bash
   # Server already started and ready for connections
   ```

2. **Test RSA Encryption/Decryption**:
   ```bash
   python3 client_tls.py
   ```

3. **Test Scenario**:
   - Login as `kami` (token: `token432`)
   - Send message to `tougen`: "Test RSA decryption fix"
   - Login as `tougen` (token: `token789`)  
   - Use `decrypt 0` with master token: `tougenAlpha@123`
   - Message should decrypt successfully! ‚úÖ

4. **Verify Keys Stay Synced**:
   ```bash
   python3 test_rsa_debug.py
   ```

### Prevention
- Server now automatically syncs public keys during login
- Key resync tool available for manual fixes: `python3 resync_keys.py`
- Debug tool available for diagnostics: `python3 test_rsa_debug.py`

The RSA decryption should now work perfectly! üéâ
